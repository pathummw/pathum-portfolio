# This is my portfolio web page :vertical_traffic_light:


This project is the second Individuel project in my KYH front end development program. I just had an idea in mind that want to try to design a web site using traffic light colors or just traffic light. My 5 years old son :boy:"Himansa" is talking about traffic lights often on the way to the pre-school and came up that idea into my mind. I could use traffic lights in my portfolio web site.
